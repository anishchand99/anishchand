                <h3>This article is going walkthrough the steps necessary to create a simple trivia application. The application 
                    will be able to request question through the use of OpenTrivia DB api. it will have options to request specific categories and level of difficulty.
                    It will keep track of the points scored and score the highest score in the browsers local storage.
                </h3>
                    <br>
                <h3>Overview</h3>
                <br>
                <ul>
                    <li class = 'unorder'> What is it? </li>
                    <li class = 'unorder'> The HTML and CSS </li>
                    <li class = 'unorder'> The JavaScript </li>
                </ul>
                <br>
                <div class = 'img-container'>
                    <img class = 'blog-pic' src="images/home.png" alt='Forget my password?' >
                    <p class='caption'> The Final Product.</p>
                </div>    
                <h3>What is it?</h3>
                <p>
                        As show in the image above, the end product is going to be a simple app that will ask the user input for the total number of questions, 
                        category and level of difficulty. When the user clicks on the 'Begin' button, the game begins. The question and the answers is obtained
                        through a request to the OpenTrivia DB. Correct answer will result in points and will add to the score according to the diffculty of the 
                        question. The questions will continue until the specified number of questions by the user is served.
                </p>
                <br>                
                <div class = 'img-container'>
                    <img class = 'blog-pic' src="images/main.png">
                    <p class='caption'> The 'main screen' of our app will look something like this.</p>
                </div>

                <h3>The HTML and the CSS</h3>
                <p>
                        As always, through the HTML portion, the main focus is going to be on what elements to place on the page and how to structure 
                        the elements. The main point of the HTML section would be to build 'three pages' namely: the intro page, the main page and the results page.
                        The intro page is the one where the user can use the filters to select the questions, the main page is where the game actually takes place, and
                        the results page is the page where we display the results of the game. These pages would just be seperate blocks of HTML elements that we
                        will dynamically display and hide depending upon the context to avoid loading of a new page everytime, somewhat like React in a way.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p class = 'introScreenHTMLCode' id = 'html-overflow'></p>
                <br>
                <p class = 'mainScreenHTMLCode' id = 'html-overflow'></p>
                <br>
                <p class = 'resultsScreenHTMLCode' id = 'html-overflow'></p>
                <br>
                <div class = 'img-container'>
                    <img class = 'blog-pic' src="images/html.png" border=2>
                    <p class='caption'> With HTML and no CSS, the page so far should look similar</p>
                </div>

                <p>
                        The CSS is going to be about making the page attractive and responsive. This can be achieved in many number of ways. 
                        The CSS is going to be pretty straightforward in this case and is self-explanatory. The CSS file can be found on this project's
                        github repo along with other necessary files. With CSS, the page would somethinglike shown in the following image. But without
                        JavaScript, it does not do anything.
                </p>
                <div class = 'img-container'>
                    <img class = 'blog-pic' src="images/css.png">
                    <p class='caption'> With CSS implemented the HTML should look similar to this</p>
                </div>
                <h3>The JavaScript</h3>
                <p> 
                    Now, we get to the main part of making this page work as desired. For this, we need to implement the JavaScript.
                    <ol class = 'steps'>
                        <li> First, we get a get a reference of all the dom elements that we will need and store them. Variable questionCount will give the number of
                            specified questions in the input box. As set by the HTML, this number is minimum '1'. Variable categoryType will store
                            the type of the category specified for the question. The difficulyLevel will store the selected difficulty level. Similarly, the necessary elements
                            like text elements and divs that are necessary are referenced as well. 
                        </li>
                        <p class = 'domElem' id = 'html-overflow'>
                        </p>    
                        <li> The most important step is to make the request. We make use of the fetch api to send the request and use promise to receive the data.
                            We store the url in the <b>request</b> variable. The categories are replaced by the corresponding numbers. We fetch to the given url.
                            We get back the promise which we convert into json using <b>.json()</b> method. We access the results of the res.json() to get access to
                            question and answers.
                        </li>
                        <p id = 'html-overflow' class='categ'>request = https://opentdb.com/api.php?amount=1&category=${categoryType}&difficulty=${difficultyLevel}&type=multiple
                            
                            This uses template string to determine the category type and difficulty level as chosen by user.
                            In case of a random category or difficulty is chosen the values will be empty so any random 
                            topic is requested. The category code is as follows specified by the api:
                        </p>
                        <p class ='fetchJS' id = 'html-overflow'>
                        </p> 
                        <li>
                            Now, we implement the function that takes care of the starting of the quiz. 
                        </li>    
                        <p class="startQuiz" id ='html-overflow'></p>
                        <li>
                            Now, we need to take care of placing choices randomly. The api provdies the correct answer and other 3 incorrect choices.
                            We provide these options to a shuffle method to ensure every time the corrrect answer is placed in a different position. 
                        </li>
                        <p class="shuffle" id ='html-overflow'></p>
                        <li>
                            Whenever an option is clicked, we need to check the answer using the onclick property of the button. Also, we need to disable
                            the buttons to avoid multiple attempts.
                        </li>
                        <p class="check" id ='html-overflow'></p><li>
                            We need to score the correct answers and make sure the next button works properly. 
                        </li>
                        <p class="score" id ='html-overflow'></p><li>
                            Finally, we take care of the results screen once the quiz ends.
                        </li>
                        <p class="results" id ='html-overflow'></p>
