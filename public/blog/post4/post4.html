                <h3>This article is an introductory article to talk about my next project: <i>A Job Applicaiton Tracker</i>.
                </h3>
                    <br>
                <h3>Overview</h3>

                    <p class='caption'> Job Hunting can be stressful. Tracking jobs effectively helps lessen the stress.</p>
                </div>    
                <h3>What is it?</h3>
                <p>
                        I will be building a job tracking application that will help to keep track of all the jobs that a user has applied to. Looking at some
                        of the popular websites like reddit, the most popular choice to keep lists of job applications is excel spreadsheets. While this works,
                        my goal is to make a website that is tailor-made for the purpose of job application tracking.
                </p>
                <br>                
                <h3>Motivation</h3>
                <p>
                    Applying to jobs is a tedious task. You have to apply to a lot job posts through various websites. While websites like LinkedIn make it easier 
                    by storing the applied jobs, a user may use a lot of different websites to apply and can lose track of the platform he/she used for applying 
                    to a certain job. I want to create an application that keeps track of all these job applications in a single place. Furthermore, I want to make it
                    possible to generate certain statisitcs that might help to visulize the job application process thus far. For example, stats to see the rejection rate,
                    success rate, interview rate, and so on. The user base for this application would be people looking to find jobs and applying to jobs. 
                </p>
                <br>
                <h3>Tentative Features</h3>
                <p> 
                    The application will have options to add jobs and keeps track of the date applied, the name of the company, the URL of the job post, 
                    job description, tech stack required for the job, any special requirements (like security clearance, sponsorship, citizenship), any 
                    additional comments that they would like to add. Similarly, there would be an option to upload and reference the resume version that 
                    they uploaded for the job post. Also, users can add their progress like heard back from the company, got an interview, got an offer, and 
                    so on which will be used to calculate the overall statistics of the job search process.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The application will be built using the PERN stack. The frontend will be built using React and CSS. If I can find some interesting and 
                    useful react components that can be fitting in the projects, I will make use of it. The backend of the project will be made using Node.js 
                    with Express. The database used will be PostgreSQL. The database will be required to have a table dealing with user authentication. 
                    The table would store the name, email, and hash of the password at the minimum. The other tables would be dealing with job 
                    applications storage using an effective schema. The frontend will have a dashboard that will give users option to add jobs and add 
                    features related to job application like date applied and similar others explained above. The backend will have several API endpoints 
                    dealing with signup, sign in, and profile at the minimum.
                </p>
                <p>
                    That's all for now. This is just pitching the idea for the next project. In the coming weeks, I will be updating the blog post to document the
                    progess of this application.
